## Summary
My goal is always grow up my professional skills. I know, if i can combine practice in real projects and training this help me will take strong experience and knowledge in FrontEnd. I have strong self-motivation for learning something new, try to write perfect code, search and using best-practise and apply it for my code. My rule is: there are no mistakes in someone who doesn't anything
